# Pivotal Tracker: Planning Poker

Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of user stories in software development. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards in the app, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.

* [Install MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) - MongoDB installation tutorial
* [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/index.html) - Mongoid official website for documentations

Planning Poker uses push notification with Faye. There are configuration files for each environments in config/environments:

    config.publisher = {
      # production faye server - change the URL so that it points to the correct server.
      domain: 'localhost:9292',
      # secret key
      secret: 'secret'
    }

Change the domain into the actual production domain when deploying the app. You might want to change the secret key as well. 

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine, and install dependencies:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:bimovidia/planning-poker.git
cd planning-poker
bundle install
```

Open a new terminal and start the faye server:

```shell
rackup faye.ru -s thin -E production -p 9292
```

Run the application locally with:

```shell
rails s
```
